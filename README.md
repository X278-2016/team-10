# Smart Cities T-Hub (Team 10)

## Improvement Ideas
The existing app is functioning, but we see many areas for improvement.  Our ideas for improvement as of 10/27 are as follows:
- Creating a real-time feature that shows multiple buses near you at a time
- Revamping the calendar feature's user interface to only show you the days when you have a trip planned, makes for less scrolling through and easy access to trips
- Share feature that allows your friends to see the trip you've planned if they would like to join
- Automatic recalculation of new route if you miss your bus
- Preferred trip type: Shortest trip, Soonest Departure, Soonest Arrival
